# Liason

Liason is a fancier name for [Middleman][middleman]; it is also a heavily opinionated [Middleman][middleman] project, preconfigured with the latest [Bootstrap][bootstrap], [Font-Awesome][fontawesome], syntax highlighting, etc. For quickly putting together new static sites. 

## Getting started

Clone the repo, then: 

``` bash
cd liason
bundle install
bundle exec middleman
```

Now go visit `http://localhost:4567` from your browser. If you see a message that says "MIDDLEMAN IS WATCHING" you're all set!
